Create a ROS package which would enable 2 people (Jolyne and Joestar) to chat with each other on the same rosnode and the same rostopic.

-Create a WS with the above yt video as reference.

├── scripts/
│   └── chat_node.py
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── package.xml

Each user has a 'chat' node running and each node works on the same topic
Check for username so that I don't display their msg as well in their rrespective terminal.
When surfing on the internet I found I needed to make .msg file to send and recieve my messages so integrating them into my CMakeFile and Packages are new to me.
I have attached a video demonstrating the code.
