Create a publisher node where the user enters commands like "forward", "turn left" etc
and the subscriber should print the position of the bot(x,y, facing direction, etc). The
position data should be communicated through a custom message called "bot_pose".
Assume bot starts from (0,0) and moves in the cartesian plane. Note: Extra points for
simulating bot movement with a state machine.


Publisher code is simple -> Ask the user whether he wants to move the bot Forward or turn left or right,etc., using a menu based Console code. When the user chooses the 
cmd of what to do, it is then published to the mov.py (The code which does the movement part)
In the mov.py -> I used StateMachine library (Idle, Move, Turn are the states), I had to store the positions of the bot as a .msg file. From the users input the bot's
position is changed and displayed.
I have demonstarted the code using a video.
Using statemachine was new to me - > Adding a few extensions and dependencies was a bit confusing
