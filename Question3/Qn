Create a publisher node where the user enters commands like "forward", "turn left" etc
and the subscriber should print the position of the bot(x,y, facing direction, etc). The
position data should be communicated through a custom message called "bot_pose".
Assume bot starts from (0,0) and moves in the cartesian plane. Note: Extra points for
simulating bot movement with a state machine.
